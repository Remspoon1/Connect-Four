# Kenzie Academy Group Project

The goal of this group project was to create a Connect Four Clone where the users will take turns depositing a token into the game board with the intent of getting four in a row without being blocked by their opponent. 

I was one of four developers on this team and was tasked with creating the code that determined if the previous play resulted in a game winning move. I did this be creating functions that iterated over the 8 possible directins from the current position to determine if they matched the current token. This code was essential to the successful completion of the project. 

Additionaly, I suggested the idea and was part of the styling team that branded the board and chips with the Kenzie logo and colors.
